This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning solution designed to help a fictional retail Superstore boost profitability, optimize sales strategies, and understand key performance drivers.
🛍️ Superstore Sales Analysis
A complete data analysis and machine learning project focused on improving business decisions for a retail Superstore by uncovering sales patterns, predicting profitability, and forecasting future performance.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Superstore sales data to understand key drivers of profit and loss. It identifies trends across product categories, regions, and discounts. Using machine learning and time series forecasting, it predicts whether an order will be profitable and estimates monthly sales for the upcoming 6 months.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze sales, profit, and discount trends across different segments

Identify factors contributing to losses

Build a Random Forest model to predict order profitability

Forecast future sales using ARIMA time series modeling

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python – Data manipulation and analysis (pandas, numpy)

Visualization – seaborn, matplotlib

Machine Learning – scikit-learn (Random Forest)

Time Series Forecasting – statsmodels (ARIMA)

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

📊 Key Insights
Technology is the most profitable product category; Furniture underperforms

West region leads in sales; South requires improvement

Q4 (Sep–Dec) shows highest profits; Jan–Feb are slow

High discounts significantly reduce profit margins (correlation: -0.86)

Random Forest model achieves 93% accuracy in predicting order profitability

📈 Recommendations
Prioritize Technology products and the West region

Limit discounts to maintain healthy profit margins

Improve marketing strategies in the South

Focus on campaigns during Q4 and March

✅ Conclusion
This end-to-end project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning can drive data-informed strategies in retail. It provides actionable insights that help optimize product focus, pricing, and regional marketing
